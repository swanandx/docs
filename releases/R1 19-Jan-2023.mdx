## You can now sort actions to show incomplete actions first

Bytebeam only pushes actions to devices if there is no other pending action. An annoyance with this was that if there was an action that was triggered long ago and has not yet completed it was hard to find that action out. With this change you can now see the incomplete actions at the top of the page.

## You can now access multiple projects in the same browser

Earlier you could only access one project at once. If you had two tabs open and switched to a different project in one of them, the other would also be automatically switched to the new project. This was happenign as project information was stored in shared local storage between tabs. We've moved the project information to the URL. Another side effect of this is that it also makes sharing dashboard URLs easlier.

## Last value panel now supports filters



You can now filter out rows being considered in last value panel. Similar support for other panels will be rolled out in upcoming releases.
